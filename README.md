# Heart-Disease-Trees-Task5
This is Task 5 of my AI/ML Internship. It focuses on implementing tree-based models for classification.

## Task Objective :
- Train Decision Tree and Random Forest models
- Visualize and interpret Decision Tree
- Compare accuracies
- Analyze feature importances
- Evaluate using cross-validation

##  Dataset :
- Source: [Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- File: `heart.csv`

##  Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Steps:
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Trained a Decision Tree classifier
3. Visualized the tree using `plot_tree()`
4. Trained a Random Forest classifier
5. Compared accuracies
6. Analyzed feature importances
7. Evaluated model using 5-fold cross-validation
